        <p>
          In June 2024, the Arev Society partnered with the Armenian Fund for Sustainable Development to launch the &quot;Digital Literacy Courses&quot; initiative. This project aimed to strengthen vulnerable social groups, particularly women, by enhancing their digital skills and basic computer knowledge—essential components for workforce integration and managing business-related tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
          We assessed over 40 initiative-interested women beneficiaries of the &quot;Vulnerable Women Empowerment (VWE)&quot; program who requested assistance in developing digital skills. The “VWE” program has supported these women to fund their vocational training (VT) or income-generating activity (IGA). Participants, ranging from 20 to 50 years old, included women whose husbands were killed or injured during the 2020 Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh) war and Artsakh refugees.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite participants' initial strong commitment, we observed a 20% decline in engagement before courses began. While active participants demonstrated encouraging progress, this article explores potential reasons causing beneficiaries' disengagement and apparent indifference toward learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          We identified several factors that discouraged beneficiaries from adhering to the program and classified them into psychological, financial, behavioral, and visionary categories.
        </p>
        <h2>Psychological factors</h2>
        <p>
          All our women beneficiaries are direct or indirect war victims, and many of them confirmed that they passed through severe traumatic experiences that have profoundly affected them. Education and learning have ceased to be a priority for these women despite professional integration's obvious necessity and significance.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>“When, in the winter of 2020, military people came to our home and explained to us that my husband’s location was unknown and that there most probably few chances of finding him alive, my mother-in-law felt in severe depression and since then, showed loss of memory. This particular mourning ambiance in the house affected my four-year-old daughter, who still has difficulties communicating with others. All this also impacted me, and participating
             in digital literacy courses was a daunting challenge, but fortunately, I decided ultimately to come, and I am happy that I did it. I imagine many women are in the same situation; they have no motivation but to earn money and aren’t interested in personal development.”
              <strong>Interview Extract: War widow, 35 years old, mother of two children - Program beneficiary, IGA: Greenhouse, Armavir region, Armenia</strong></em>
        </p>
        <p>
        Among various psychological factors, a lack of self-confidence plays a critical role. This low self-confidence stems from
        patriarchal societal stereotypes that suggest women don&#39;t need to be technologically proficient to be good mothers for
        their families. Of course, this fallacy is baseless, and beneficiaries realize rather quickly that this is more of a psychological
        aspect that could be addressed through a learning process.        
        </p>
        <p>
        Interestingly, some interviewees were initially confident that their knowledge was sufficient to meet current employment
        demands. However, after the first assessment and introduction to digital literacy courses, they quickly realized that their
        skills were significantly inadequate for today&#39;s job market requirements.        
        </p>
        <p>
        Finally, another significant psychological factor is resistance to anything new, the propensity to remain in a comfort zone,
        and the avoidance of commitment to a consistent learning process, which is sometimes complex and requires intellectual
        strain.        
        </p>
        <p>
        “Before, I had not realized the importance of digital literacy; that seemed more like something my children would
        discuss. After the first few lessons, I started noticing how much I was deprived of in basic day-to-day life, let alone work.
        It was a great challenge for me to memorize and understand everything quickly; however, I am glad I had made up my
        mind to apply, as I am already using some of the acquired skills in my daily life.

        </p>
        <h2>Financial factors</h2>
        <p>All our beneficiaries are financially vulnerable, and their income is composed of state allowance and salary or income from
        small businesses created through our support. Although the training courses are free of charge, transportation costs
        necessary to attend digital literacy training courses weigh heavily on their monthly budget. When they need to choose
        between expenses, transportation costs for training take the back seat.
        </p>
        <p>Another financial hindrance is the lack of basic computer equipment at home, which forces them to attend in-person
          digital literacy courses and limits the learning process during training sessions.
        </p>
        <p>“I wish I had a computer at home so that I could take digital literacy courses remotely and practice my skills afterward.
          Our only notebook is for my daughter, a student who takes it with her for her studies at university. “Interview

        </p>
        <p>Some interviewees explained they wished to attend digital literacy courses but work as employees elsewhere, and the rigid
        schedule of working hours is incompatible with the timing of the courses. Here, once again, beneficiaries opt to conserve
        their stable income employment instead of attending digital literacy courses with hypothetical long-term gain.
        </p>
        <p>“I work the whole week in the local supermarket, except Sundays, and despite my strong desire to attend these courses,
        it is impossible because I have four children at home who need me all the time and almost for everything. I could
        participate in these courses remotely if I had a computer at home. Alas, I haven’t any, and I can’t afford it in the near
        future. <strong>Interview Extract: Refugee, 41 years old, mother of four children - Program beneficiary, IGA:
        Greenhouse, Ararat region, Armenia.</strong>
        </p>
        <h2>Behavioral factors</h2>
        <p>We also observed that many beneficiaries feel anxious about new technologies and worry about making mistakes or
        appearing incompetent in front of others. However, after a few courses, this feeling faded when beneficiaries realized that
        almost everyone has the same difficulties harnessing new skills. The indifference and lack of motivation hinge on the
        absence of an immediate gain.
        </p>
        <p>The fact that the advantages of such competencies are not immediately tangible or don&#39;t instantly generate income often
        leads to a passive behavioral attitude. However, one of the interviewees confessed that owing to her new digital
        competencies, she earned more respect among colleagues at the workplace.
        </p>
        <p>“When at the workplace, I told them that I could help them easily calculate percentages with Excel. At first, everyone
        looked at me surprised. Once it was done, they were all very respectful. Of course, I didn&#39;t tell them I was taking digital
        literacy courses to avoid negative comments, such as &#39;You have three children, but still, you are on school benches.&#39;
        However, I am very happy that I can do simple but useful things. <strong>Interview Extract: War widow, 37 years old,
        mother of three children - Program beneficiary, IGA: Calf breeding, Armavir region, Armenia.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
        Ignorance of foreign languages impedes adult beneficiaries&#39; swift learning progress. They remain extremely timid and
        don’t dare ask aloud for specific technical terms they don&#39;t understand all at once. They prefer keeping silent rather than
        revealing their lack of comprehension. This forces the trainer to intuitively identify knowledge gaps and address them,
        often without explicit feedback from the participants.
        </p>
        <p>
        “When I am home, I try to practice all I learned during the course, and when I see that I am stuck, I try to find solutions
        on YouTube. However, the best courses are in English, and I am not at ease with foreign languages, so I wait until the
        next course to ask for help. <strong>Interview Extract: Refugee woman, 35 years old, mother of three children -

        </p>
        <h2>Visionary Factors</h2>
        <p>
        Economic precarity dictates priorities, and most of them should be short-term. This is a widespread mindset among
        beneficiaries. Many participants struggled to envision how digital skills could concretely improve their lives, particularly
        given that they live in rural areas. Age-related self-limitation hinders embracing future opportunities and possible
        changes. They consider themselves too old to learn new skills, so the output of any initiative should be immediate.
        </p>
        <p>
        “I don’t think that I am interested in participating in such courses because there is no employment in new technologies in
        our village. These courses are useful for young people who want to become programmers, but not for me. I am too old for
        that. I make four haircuts per day on average, and every evening, I am paid off, and all this without any use of digital
        skills.” <strong>Interview Extract: Refugee woman, 41 years old, mother of four children - Program beneficiary,

        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
        We at the Arev Society and our partner, the Armenian Fund for Sustainable Development, have observed all these patterns
        and understand that we need to adapt our offer to vulnerable populations to foster digitally illiterate people&#39;s adhesion to a
        lifelong learning process. In our next training sessions, we will invite our successful trainees to demonstrate how digital
        literacy led them to economic opportunities and improved their daily lives. This approach could be particularly effective if
        it is done through peer support. We strive to reduce the digital divide in society and promote digital inclusion.
