                                            people goes beyond theory. The <strong>Arev Society</strong>{" "}
                                            proves this with its proactive approach, exemplified by
                                            identification of critical food insecurity issues. We recognize
                                            that these challenges require not just aid, but custom-designed
                                            and comprehensive solutions tailored to each specific situation.

                                            While implementing humanitarian emergency aid projects in
                                            Armenia, we have identified a real need among women from war
                                            victim families seeking employment or creating small businesses.
                                            More than 70 % of vulnerable women are unemployed and have only
                                            State allowance, which is insufficient for a decent life. They
                                            were always dependent on their husbands because of their
                                            insufficient knowledge of entrepreneurial skills and ignorance
                                            of job market requirements.

                                            The absence of relevant skills and education worsen women's
                                            vulnerability. Confined to the domestic sphere, relegating their
                                            talents and aspirations, they were excluded as candidates for
                                            employment and stable income. For this reason, support from
                                            nonprofit organizations in building their financial independence
                                            could play a pivotal role. Achieving this self-sufficiency
                                            through economic empowerment becomes easy when you are supported
                                            and motivated.

                                            Financial independence for a woman is not just about earning
