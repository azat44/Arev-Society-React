                 we are compelled to confront uncomfortable truths about women affected by war and forced
                displacement, whose struggles are magnified by the loss of support systems and
                access to essential resources.

                                        For decades, women have been significantly underrepresented and undervalued
                                        across nearly all areas of economic activity. This pervasive  issue has deep roots in

                                        Displacement often severs connections to family, community, and professional

                                        significant barriers are the  lack of digital

                                        not just advantageous but  essential for economic  participation and empowerment.
                                        Digital literacy enables access to  information, online job markets, and remote work
                                        opportunities. On the other hand, financial  literacy is crucial for managing limited
                                        resources,  understanding financial products, and  making informed economic decisions. 
                                        For war-affected women, these  skills can mean the difference  between economic survival and poverty.

                                        Limited financial resources and  skills hinder  women's economic progress. State and
                                        private empowerment   programs are  often out of reach due  to co-funding
                                        requirements. High-interest  loans from banks and credit  institutions risk worsening
                                        their financial situation.
                                        Many women need  vocational and professional  training for self-sufficiency but face
                                        barriers like high  costs and lack of awareness.  Quality   training  programs often have
                                        fees these women  cannot afford. Information about available  programs may not reach
                                        them,  especially if they are   digitally isolated. This  combination of financial
                                        constraints and limited access to skill  development opportunities creates a significant
                                        obstacle  to economic empowerment  for these women.

                                Since launching the women empowerment program in 2020, we have studied over a
                                hundred cases of women&#39;s economic empowerment so far. To gather real-world data,
                                we visited and met each beneficiary in person. Our experience demonstrates that a
                                comprehensive approach combining in-kind contributions for business creation,
                                targeted vocational training, and continuous business management coaching is an
                                effective strategy for enhancing employment opportunities and increasing income
                                among women from war victim or refugee families.

                                        We have always avoided cash inputs to support our beneficiaries, eliminating, thus,
                                        any risk of support misuse. One of the cornerstones of our approach is providing in-
                                        kind contributions that support business creation. These contributions can take
                                        various forms, including equipment, supplies, livestock, and resources necessary for
                                        starting and running an  income-generating activity. This support  is crucial for these
                                        vulnerable women who  lack access to capital or credit, allowing them to focus on
                                        building sustainable businesses that can provide for their  families.
