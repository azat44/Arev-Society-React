                            <p>Anna’s peaceful life was paradise until the war took her husband away. Now, it was up to her to decide whether to give up and condemn her family to anguish and poverty or resist and move forward. The choice for Anna was obvious.</p>
                            <p>She learned about the “Vulnerable Women Empowerment” program, implemented by the <a href="https://www.af4sd.org/en/women-empowerment-armenia-armenian-fund-for-sustainable-development/" target="_blank">Armenian Fund for Sustainable Development</a>, from one of her acquaintances, whose husband had also participated in the war events; however, doubts crept in from different directions.</p>
                            <p>Despite initially being skeptical, Anna mustered up her courage, ignored her doubts, and applied for both training and business funding.</p>
                            <p>A few days later, the awaited response came: Her application was approved.</p>
                            <p>With more than three years of experience as an accountant and a degree in economics, Anna immediately knew the kind of business she wanted to set up in Massis, Armenia, around 30 kilometers away from Yerevan.</p>
                            <p>Now, she is the director of her accounting agency, which she named after the Armenian Fund for Sustainable Development: “Sustainable Accounting,” assiduous and unwavering, forging her own future day by day.</p>
                            <p>Despite the numerous challenges she has to face as a single mother of 3 underage children and a caretaker for her late husband’s elderly parents, Anna is sure that she is on the right track.</p>
                            <p>She is doing all the things her husband has ever wished for: having her own business, where she never has to work under someone, and being a role model for their kids, giving them unconditional love and care.</p>
                            <p>Anna confessed that she genuinely wishes no one gets to experience the horrors she has gone through.</p>
                            <p>Life didn’t give her the chance to be carefree or laze around waiting for some miracle; she had to make those miracles happen herself.</p>
                            <p>She incessantly develops her skills and expands her knowledge, surprising her children with yet another book to read in the evening.</p>
                            <p>Anna understood success wouldn’t be overnight, and after seven months of diligent and patient work, Anna’s accounting office already had 20 clients.</p>
                            <p>“It was also an incredibly rewarding experience to return to the Armenian Fund for Sustainable Development, not as an applicant, but as a trainer. I had the privilege of teaching the basics of accounting to new beneficiaries during the capacity-building training the Fund organized.”</p>
                            <p>Confident and optimistic about her success, Anna bravely looks to the future, planning to expand her client database and open several branches.</p>
                            <p>Moreover, Anna envisions integrating her eldest son, a diligent computer programming student, into the family’s “Sustainable Accounting” business. His coding skills, combined with Anna’s experience, could propel the firm forward, keeping it at the forefront of technical advancement.</p>
                            <p>Anna lost her husband during the 2020 war. She has three children and is a beneficiary of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/arevsociety/posts/pfbid02qcYMEVdWqPTmPYppSe5GsScQhqQ4vUcKywRcJHQHVgbyRnDdM7iqekP3vzp5H1n5l" target="_blank">AF4SD's "Vulnerable Women Empowerment" program. </a> </p>
