                            We went on this journey to meet with Lusine after we purchased calves
                            within the framework of the “Women Empowerment “project. <br />
                            <br />
                            Her village is not very far from Yerevan, but the roads in this community
                            are rugged and awful, as her life experiences after the war.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            We called her once in the village, and she told us where to wait for her.{" "}
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Before we arrived, we were struck by the sight of an old "Lada" being
                            skillfully driven by a young boy.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            This unexpected scene prompted us to question the circumstances that led a
                            boy of such a tender age to take the wheel. Little did we know that the
                            answer to this query would unveil a poignant story of loss,
                            responsibility, and a determination to rise above adversity. <br />
                            <br />
                            A few minutes later, she arrived in the same car and introduced the young
                            driver, her son. A youngster who supports her mother and sisters because
                            there is no one else to rely on after his father was lost during the war.{" "}
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            The house where Lusine is living is her brother-in-law's, who offered her
                            the dwelling until she buys something for her. <br />
                            <br />
                            We asked if she had enough money to buy a house, and she told us that she
                            wanted to breed these calves, sell the offspring, and gradually accumulate
                            the means, and one day, maybe she could realize her aim.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            She has three children and works in the village school administration in
                            an administrative position for a meager salary. Still, recently, she
                            discovered that she could make some money if she mastered some graphic
                            design skills. <br />
                            <br />
                            We helped her fund this training, bought a notebook to improve her skills,
                            and gave her an appointment in a few months to see her progress. <br />
                            <br />
                            We asked her if it was not too hard to continue, and she looked at her
                            young children, sighed, looked at us, and replied with confidence, “ Who
                            will push me, if not me?” <br />
