                            <h1 className="title-story-page">I had to become someone who would pull us together</h1>
                            <p className="date-story-page">Women Empowerment</p>
                            <p>I used to be fearless and proud. When my family and I fled from Artsakh to Armenia, I had lost all hope of a stable, happy life. Losing my homeland made me shrink and become vulnerable. With my husband having a 2nd group disability and my four children heartbroken and scared, I was ready to give up.</p>
                            <p>Having more than 15 years of experience working as a history teacher in Martakert, Artsakh, I never imagined that, at some point, I would also become part of such ruthless and unfair historical events.</p>
                            <p>The turning point for me was when I realized just how much my depressive thoughts were affecting my family, especially my four children, who were weighed down by my sorrows. I clearly understood that our lives could not go on like this anymore, and I had to become someone who would pull us together.</p>
                            <p>My sister Narine, who was also displaced from Artsakh, found a call for applications on the Armenian Fund for Sustainable Development Facebook page, applied herself, and prompted me as well.</p>
                            <p>She is my biggest role model, as her optimistic and determined attitude has always motivated me to move forward. I wrote my business plan with a lot of enthusiasm but without a slight hope of success.</p>
                            <p>After receiving funding for our farm, a happy future started seeming a little bit closer. We decided to maintain our farm the way we did it in our motherland; we even named the cows purchased in the framework of the “Vulnerable Women in Armenia” project after the animals we kept in Artsakh.</p>
                            <p>Now, I am working hard to develop a sustainable business and expand my farm. In the future, we plan to keep sheep. Currently, we can sell our produce, specifically our cheeses, which are in high demand in neighboring towns.</p>
                            <p>Our bonds with other people and by our communities define our strength. I am incredibly thankful to all the people who have helped us settle in Geghamavan, Armenia, and most importantly, that they never made us feel out of place or unwelcome here.</p>
                            <p>I do not think I will ever get through the loss of my homeland. However, I know that I am capable of providing my family and my beloved children with everything to make them happy. My eldest daughter wants to become a psychologist once she graduates, and my eldest son is working hard to help us provide a stable income. Thanks to their unconditional love and support, I have faith in myself.</p>
                            <p>Shuhsanik is a refugee from Artsakh with 4 children (Nagorno-Karabakh) and a beneficiary of the <a href="https://www.af4sd.org/en/women-empowerment-armenia-armenian-fund-for-sustainable-development/" target="_blank">AF4SD “Refugee Women Empowerment” program</a>.</p>
