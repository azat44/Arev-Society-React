                            When news first arrived that Nvard's husband had gone missing during the
                            war, a deep sadness fell upon their household.The heavy burden of his
                            disappearance weighed down the family, plunging them into profound grief.
                            She had to face many challenges since then. She became the sole provider
                            once her father-in-law seriously injured his arm and her mother-in-law
                            stopped working, struggling with not knowing what had happened to her son.
                            Nvard spent most days praying for his safe return and hoping he was still
                            alive. However, she knew she had to be strong for her children no matter
                            how difficult it was. <br />
                            <br />
                            In 2023, Nvard learned about Arev Society's women's empowerment project
                            supporting war victim families through small business creation and decided
                            to apply for funding. It was an opportunity to get financial support to
                            build a greenhouse by their house and become self-sufficient, envisioning
                            growing seasonal vegetables to sell locally. <br />
                            <br />
                            The prospect of selecting equipment for a greenhouse and managing
                            everything was daunting, but she set her worries aside, focusing instead
                            on this being the lift her family desperately needed.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            This idea also encouraged her mother-in-law to help run this, sharing her
                            cultivation knowledge and skills from the past. It was her chance to aid
                            the whole family. We discussed this project at their home before the
                            preparatory works began, and her mother-in-law held her hand tightly,
                            saying, "Now we are building our new life within these walls until my son
                            comes home." <br />
                            <br />
                            The implementing partner, the
                            <a href="https://af4sd.org" target="_blank">
                                Armenian Fund for Sustainable Development{" "}
                            </a>
                            , is helping them organize the greenhouse construction that will allow
                            them to reap wintertime rewards when produce is scarce across the region.{" "}
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            There is still much uncertainty ahead for Nvardâ€™s family . However, the
                            garden that had represented sorrow and despair will be a vibrant source of
                            life and hope for a family yearning for the day they hear the familiar
                            knock at the door announcing their hero's safe return.
