                            After the war, I stayed alone with my son and daughter without any
                            resources except a state allowance. We thought it would be great to launch
                            an activity where all family members could work because my son is working
                            in mining, and it is too hard for a meager salary. <br />
                            <br />
                            I thought about purchasing sewing machines, making all sorts of clothes,
                            and even creating custom outfits. Besides, my daughter-in-law is very
                            talented at modeling clothes, and we thought it would be a great chance to
                            find some money to fund a small business where all of us could
                            participate. <br />
                            <br />
                            Last year in 2022, I heard amid a conversation with other widows that the{" "}

                                Armenian Fund for Sustainable Development{" "}
                            </a>{" "}
                            supported women from war victim families in Vanadzor to launch
                            income-generating activities. <br />
                            <br />
                            Still, I had almost no belief in my chance, after all the adversities I
                            faced, that an organization may assist us in supporting business creation.{" "}
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            I kept following their page, and in April 2023, I learned that a New
                            York-based Arev Society charity funded a “Women Empowerment” project,
                            which supports war victim families through small business creation
                            combined with vocational training for those who need to learn professional
                            skills. <br />
                            <br />
                            Together with my close friend, who is also a war widow, we decided to
                            apply. <br />
                            <br />
                            After submitting our application, we were convened to the entrepreneurial
                            skills training. Still, I should confess that I was wondering if it was
                            worth paying a round trip ticket to Yerevan to attend training if there
                            might be no follow-up. <br />
                            <br />
                            They gave me a business creation template that I filled out and returned
                            to them. A few days later, they called me and invited me to a meeting with
                            the funding committee, where I would present my business plan. <br />
                            <br />
                            My presentation was as challenging as an exam, but it went great. Finally,
                            my application was approved, and they bought my sewing machines and
                            organized the delivery. <br />
                            <br />
                            Today, I have this inevitable challenge of finding clients and enough
                            orders to meet ends. <br />
                            <br />
                            However, it does not really matter because, when I look back, I understand
                            that I transformed my pain of loss into a driving force to rebuild a life
                            worth living because I have no choice but to continue! <p />
