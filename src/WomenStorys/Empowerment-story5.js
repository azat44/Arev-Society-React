                            Life can often take us down unexpected paths, forcing us to confront
                            unimaginable challenges. In the heart of Armenia, a story of strength,
                            resilience, and the unwavering human spirit exists. <br />
                            <br />
                            It's the story of Liza, a mother of three who has found a way to rebuild
                            her dreams and secure a brighter future for her family in the face of
                            tragedy. <br />
                            <br />
                            After the war, Liza, supported by her mother, renovated the backyard
                            premises and decided to set up her small pastry within her family's
                            grocery store. <br />
                            <br />
                            Thanks to the joint project of Arev Society and the
                            <a href="https://af4sd.org" target="_blank">
                                Armenian Fund for Sustainable Development{" "}
                            </a>
                            “Women Empowerment” project, Liza was provided with the means to purchase
                            all the essential equipment she needed to open her pastry corner. <br />
                            <br />
                            With her new equipment, Liza can now offer to her charming young visitors
                            from the school in front of delicious pastries and sandwiches. <br />
                            <br />
                            All her three children are excelling in their studies and are among the
                            best of their fellows at university and school. <br />
                            <br />
                            The eldest, Gohar, is a brilliant student at Medical University. She has
                            emerged as a standout student and obtained a scholarship for her academic
                            success. She often says, "Every success in my academic journey is a
                            tribute to my father, who always believed in my potential." <br />
                            <br />
                            When we were leaving her shop, she said, "The Women Empowerment Project
                            gave me not just equipment but hope and a chance to create a better future
                            for my children." <br />
                            <br />
                            Liza's story is a reminder that, in the end, the human spirit is the most
                            vital ingredient of all, capable of crafting the sweetest and most
                            uplifting of life's stories. <br />
