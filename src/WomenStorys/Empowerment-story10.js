                            <p className="date-story-page">Women Empowerment</p>
                            <p>I was the happiest woman in the world when my husband was still by my side. His mere presence was enough for me to wake up each day with gratitude. He built our house, crafted all the furniture by hand, and allowed me to dedicate myself fully to raising our two children.</p>
                            <p>Since we lost him in the 2020 Artsakh war, my life has been irrevocably changed. With my children still in school and other family members unable to work, I became the sole provider for our family with my elderly father-in-law.</p>
                            <p>Although I understood the responsibilities now resting on my shoulders, moving on immediately was impossible. I spent countless nights weeping and praying that he might return safely to me. That, however, never happened. Depression slowly consumed me, and truthfully, I will never fully heal from his loss.</p>
                            <p>I learned about the "Vulnerable Women Empowerment in Armenia" project of the <a href="https://www.af4sd.org/en/women-empowerment-armenia-armenian-fund-for-sustainable-development/" target="_blank">Armenian Fund for Sustainable Development</a> from the Metsamor municipality. Initially, I was skeptical about the outcome and afraid of failure. My independent nature also made it difficult to seek help, as I had never been one to rely on others. However, I changed my mind after speaking with acquaintances who had received funding from the project.</p>
                            <p>As there was a demand for fresh farm eggs, I submitted a proposal to purchase a hundred chickens and feed for laying hens. When I was informed that the project was approved, I transformed a portion of our garden into a small chicken farm. Now, I'm able to produce and sell eggs in small quantities, with plans to increase production gradually.</p>
                            <p>My father-in-law, despite his own grief, has been an unexpected source of strength and support. He helps me tend to the chickens daily and distribute feed.</p>
                            <p>I am not really able to explain my feelings after the launch of this activity, but it keeps me busy constantly and helps me focus on the present moment. I also felt a sense of accomplishment and connection to the land my husband loved so much.</p>
                            <p>Soaring egg sales motivate me to work harder and dream bigger. My children, too, have redoubled their efforts in their studies, hoping to eventually contribute financially.</p>
                            <p>Everything we accomplish and every success we achieve serves as a living tribute to my beloved husband, the cherished father of my children.</p>
