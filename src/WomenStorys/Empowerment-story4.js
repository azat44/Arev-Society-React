                            Before you arrive in Gandzaqar in the Tavush region, it takes you a
                            two-hour journey. But, when you arrive, you find yourself in a picturesque
                            landscape surrounded by mountains, and all is green. <br />
                            <br />
                            Here, almost on the highest hill of the village, lives Taguhi, our” Women
                            Empowerment “project beneficiary, who lost her husband during the 2020
                            war. <br />
                            <br />
                            We met with her several times this year. When we came here in July 2023,
                            she was building new premises for raising chickens, and to tell the truth,
                            at the time, we felt the scale of the building project was overly
                            ambitious. But she was confident. She said she would complete the work by
                            September 2023 and kept her word. <br />
                            <br />
                            In the meantime, we bought incubators and some chicken. Now, she has
                            hundreds of chickens, several turkeys,pigs, and a small quantity of eggs
                            for daily sale. Though still in the fledgling stages, this small
                            production created a sustainable income stream, but she won’t stop here;
                            it is just the beginning. <br />
                            <br />
                            In addition to this activity, she works as a part-time administrative
                            employee in the local municipality, and she accompanies her children daily
                            during the 10-kilometer commute, which is not easy on these mountainous
                            roads. <br />
                            <br />
                            We sat in her beautiful yard, leaned on the stone table crafted by her
                            husband before the war, and began talking to her about her plans. When you
                            speak to her about the future, you feel an interior strength and
                            resilience but especially a determination for the precise purpose: to
                            ensure a prosperous future for her children. <br />
                            <br />
                            After losing so much, Taguhi remains committed to honoring her husband’s
                            dreams and keeping their family rooted in Gandzaqar village. “Financial
                            independence for me is not just about earning money; it’s about gaining
                            autonomy, self-reliance, dignity, stability, and the capacity to
                            financially support me and my children without relying on others.” <br />
                            <br />
                            And if her New Year’s projections prove accurate, 2024 could take her
                            poultry farm to the next level. By 2025, Taguhi expects a surge in
                            customer demand, allowing her to resign from administrative work and focus
                            solely on her chickens and turkeys. Any profits beyond household
                            necessities will be reinvested into expansion plans like additional coops,
                            livestock, and staff to lighten her workload. <br />
                            <br />
                            She has another dream. She pointed to the mountain opposite and said: "We
                            have a lovely plot of land, and I want to organize an ecotourism activity
                            dedicated to my husband, a war hero. I will certainly do it because I know
                            my way, my destination. <br />
                            <br />
