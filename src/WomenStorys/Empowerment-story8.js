                            <p>The 2020 war in Artsakh has left Astghik’s, among many other vulnerable women’s, peaceful lives wholly ruptured. During those obscure and disheartening times, she concentrated on searching for her husband, who was declared missing in action, which, alas, was in vain. Besides, she had to figure out how to keep on living while being the sole caretaker of her three underage children and make ends meet at her rented apartment.</p>
                            <p>She desperately needed someone to rely on, some stability in her life, and at least a little faith in her future. Moreover, despite having her heart shattered upon learning of the death of her husband, Astghik didn’t have time to mourn her loss, as now the wellbeing of her family depended solely on her, replacing both parents for her kids.</p>
                            <p>With the support of the <a href="https://www.af4sd.org/en/women-empowerment-armenia-armenian-fund-for-sustainable-development/" target="_blank">Armenian Fund for Sustainable Development</a>, she regained her confidence and stood firmly on her own two feet.</p>
                            <p>Astghik learned about the “Vulnerable Women Empowerment” project from the municipality of Ashtarak and realized she could not let this opportunity pass her by. After successfully applying, she received the opportunity to participate in vocational training and learn the necessary skills to embark on her new journey as an entrepreneur.</p>
                            <p>Before applying to the program, Astghik worked in a beauty salon and had always heard people say that opening a business was not for everyone. However, staying faithful to her decision, she wholeheartedly committed to the business, surpassing all the challenges and doubtful glances of others.</p>
                            <p>Looking back, she couldn’t believe that she would ever be able to own a beauty salon in the center of Ashtarak, Armenia. Going to work every day and the thought of bringing joy and satisfaction to her clients make it all worth it.</p>
                            <p>Despite her achievements, she remains humble and confident. Astghik isn’t planning to stop either, as there is always room for improvement and perfecting her skills. For some, hairdressing may seem easy, but it requires constant perfection and skill acquisition to adapt to constantly changing technologies.</p>
                            <p>Astghik promised herself that she would never stop or say, “I cannot,” because if her husband could defend their homeland, she could do the same for her family.</p>
                            <p>Her accomplishments inspire her family and children by teaching them to stay strong and never give up.</p>
                            <p>Astghik lost her husband during the 2020 war. She is a beneficiary of the <a href="https://medium.com/@arevsociety/women-empowerment-in-armenia-c9927926348a" target="_blank"> AF4SD's “Vulnerable Women Empowerment” program</a>.</p>
                            <p>The Arev Society provides management support to the <a href="https://www.af4sd.org/en/women-empowerment-armenia-armenian-fund-for-sustainable-development/" target="_blank">AF4SD “Vulnerable Women Economic Empowerment in Armenia” program</a>.</p>
